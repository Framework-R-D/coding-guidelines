# Dependencies on external software

Ideally, the framework will depend very little on external software[^1].
However, to avoid reimplementing (and maintaining) existing technology, the framework will need to depend on some external software.
To determine whether the framework should gain such a dependency, one should carefully evaluate what burdens that dependency will place on the developer and, more importantly, on the user.

[^1]: *External software* means any software not provided by the code under development.  
  It can be software that is either natively provided by the system or installed onto the system.
